# housebell
This is a small script to bring my old and non-smart front [doorbell](https://www.str-elektronik.de/katalog/product/ht2022-3-haustelefon-gong) into the digital age. 

It sends a message via mqtt if someone uses the door or house ring. 
Furthermore, MQTT messages can be received to open the front door.
The ESP32 is powered directly from the bell system, so no external power supply is required.
